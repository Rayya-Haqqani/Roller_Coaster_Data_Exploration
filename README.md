# Roller_Coaster_Data_Exploration
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on a roller coaster dataset using Python. The project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation with pandas, visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, and statistical analysis. It provides insights into roller coaster characteristics and their geographical distribution, potentially valuable for theme park enthusiasts and industry analysts.

Key components include:
1. Data Import and Preparation: Loading data from 'coaster_db.csv', selecting relevant columns, and renaming for clarity.

2. Data Cleaning: Handling duplicates and null values (commented out, but available).

3. Exploratory Visualizations: 
   - Histogram and density plot of coaster speeds
   - Scatter plot comparing speed and height
   - Pair plot for multiple feature comparisons
   - Correlation heatmap

4. Feature Analysis: Examining relationships between coaster attributes like speed, height, year introduced, and G-force.

5. Geographical Insights: Analyzing average coaster speeds by location, focusing on locations with at least 10 coasters.
